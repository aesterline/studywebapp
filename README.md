# studywebapp

I am using the application to study how a clojure web application might work.   I would like to use the new Servlet 3.0 spec [AsyncContext](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/AsyncContext.html).   My hope is I can use some of the concurrency forms in clojure to help me write a good async webapp.

I am currently using Jetty 8.

I hope that by the end of this study session, I will have an runnable war.

## Usage
